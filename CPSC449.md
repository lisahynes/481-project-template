## CPSC 449 Mondrian Art Assignment

Below are a few samples runs of my code and the output it produced. The task was to make a recursive function that created random mondrian art by cutting the image into radom sections and filling in each space with a random colour. I split my image down the middle to get different shades of green on the right and red on the left and I added in random line widths to add variation to my project.
