Welcome to my Portfolio that contains two projects that were created in my CPSC 481 and CPSC 449 classes that showcase my design skills. 

In my CPSC 481 class, we learnt how to design an app and create a prototype for it. My group members, Kowther Hassan and Stepahnie Ross, and myself created a field guide app for indentifying Alberta Wildflowers. Please see the link above to see our completed project and all of the project components we created. 

As well, in my CPSC 449 class the first assignment consisted of creating a program to produce random Mondrian art using the haskell programming language. Please see the link above to see the sample output from the program I created.
