Welcome to my Portfolio that contains two projects that were created in my CPSC 481 and CPSC 449 classes that showcase my design skills. 

In my CPSC 481 class, we learnt how to design an app and create a prototype for it. We worked in groups and my group consisted of Kowther Hassan, Stephanie Ross and myself. We created a field guide app prototype for identifying Alberta Wildflowers. The project was broken down into 5 parts. Please click the CPSC 481 Project tab above to view each component we created including the final prototype (P3 - Hi-Fi Prototypes and Heuristic Evaluations).

As well, in my CPSC 449 class the first assignment consisted of creating a program to produce random Mondrian art using the haskell programming language. Please click the CPSC 449 Assignment tab above to see the sample output from the program I created.
