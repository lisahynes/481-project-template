## Project Idea

![](https://kowther.github.io/FieldGuide-481/wildflower_small.png)

A guide to identify, learn and share Alberta’s 100+ species of wildflowers. Enjoy all the familiarities of a traditional paper field guide, with more images and species information. Foster a community via the app, where users can share sightings, images and connect with each other.

Plants can be identified by either searching key plant characteristics (color, petal shape, etc) and location or by using our automatic photo recognition system. A user will be able to easily search through images to find a wildflower and any information related to it that they are looking for. Pictures taken and information about a plant’s location/characteristics can be shared with others by pinpointing sightings on a global map. This is a great feature for finding rarer species. 

This app is targeted to anyone interested in identifying wildflowers in Alberta. The text descriptions are easy enough for a beginner to understand but with the option to expand for more detailed scientific information for more advanced users.

Take this app out on an evening stroll in a nearby field or on a hike in one of Alberta’s national parks. With internet connection, you can share and update sighting locations on a map in real time, and use our automatic recognition tools. Or use the app offline with the searching key tool. People of all ages and backgrounds can enjoy and learn about Alberta’s stunning collection of wildflowers with this app.
